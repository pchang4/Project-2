# Project 2: Responsive Web Design 

## Overview
Most Design programs have websites. Eastern Washington University has *never* had one. It's time to change that. 

In this project, you will be creating a Responsive Website Design for EWU's VCD program. As always, it's up to you to uncover the details of the project.
